	The malabayabas, or Philippine teak, is endemic to Batangas. The province is also home to the kabag (Haplonycteris fischeri), one of the world's smallest fruit bats. In the municipality of Nasugbu, wild deer still inhabit the remote areas of barangays Looc, Papaya, Bulihan, and Dayap.

In the second half of 2006, scientists from the United States discovered that the Coral Triangle has its centre at the Isla Verde Passage, a part of the province. According to the study made by American marine biologist Dr. Kent Carpenter, Batangas seas host more than half of the world's species of coral. It is also home to dolphins and once in a while, the passage of the world's biggest fish: the whale shark or the butanding, as the locals call it may be observed. The municipality of San Juan has a resident marine turtle or pawikan. Pawikans like the Olive ridley sea turtle, leather back sea turtle, and green sea turtle can be seen in Nasugbu up to the present.<br><br>

Batangas comprises 29 municipalities and 5 cities. In land terms, Nasugbu is the largest municipality in Batangas with over 278.51km² while San Nicolas is the smallest municipality with 22.61 km². In population density, Taal is the most densely populated with over 2,066 people per km² but Lobo is the least densely populated with over 230 people per km².<br><br>
