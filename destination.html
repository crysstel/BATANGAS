		<h2>Montemaria International Pilgrimage and Conference Center</h2><br><br>
		<h3>THE MOTHER OF ALL ASIA – TOWER OF PEACE</h3><br>
		MONTEMARIA is a pilgrimage center dedicated to Mary, Mother of All Asia. The development was conceived as a destination to attract devotees and pilgrims. It can be considered as a tourism and/or retirement village.

Nestled at the heart of the 130-hectare township is the Montemaria International Pilgrimage & Conference Center, a faith-based tourism destination and a legacy project of Batangas Gov. Dodo Mandanas, MAPI’s founding chairman.

The 8-hectare tourism destination project is owned and being developed by MONTEMARIA ASIA PILGRIMS, INC. (MAPI), a stock non-profit organization registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Its centerpiece is the MOTHER OF ALL ASIA – TOWER OF PEACE, which is constructed atop the plateau’s highest point with an elevation of 148 meters above sea level, overlooking the Verde Island Passage, reputed to be the center of the center of marine bio- diversity of the world, as she welcomes all domestic and international seafaring vessels entering and seeking refuge in the serene calm waters of Batangas bay.

The Montemaria International Pilgrimage & Conference Center long-term plan is to create a walkable friendly community with covered pathways inter- connecting all the buildings and religious theme park attractions, landscaped gardens and waterways planted with different species of shade and fruit bearing trees.<br><br>

		<h2>Verde Island</h2><br><br>
		<h3>Isla Verde Tropical Friendly Resort</h3><br>
		Isla Verde Tropical Friendly Resort is on a small island in the Verde Island Passage between Batangas on Luzon and Puerto Galera on Mindoro in the Philippines. We are only about an hour and a half by coach from Manila to Batangas, then a short ride to Tabangao to take a banca across the strait.

The Verde Island Passage is famous for the diversity of its marine life and people come from around the world to our island to dive the surrounding reefs. Our Resort is right at the boundary of the Declared Marine Park, providing easy snorkelling access to the shallower corals and fish.<br><br>

		<h2>Masasa Beach</h2><br><br>
		<h3>Summer Vacation is in Your Hands! Visit This Beach with Turquoise Waters and Powdery White Sand</h3><br>
		Masasa Beach is arguably the best beach in Tingloy, the only municipality in Batangas that is not on mainland Luzon. Its main island is the fish-shaped Maricaban, off the tip of Calumpang Peninsula separating Balayan Bay from Batangas Bay.

The truth is, the sand here isn’t as pearly white as what you would expect in Boracay or Palawan, but what Masasa Beach lacks in the brightness of its sand it makes up for in the vibrance of waves. Its crystal clear, shallow waters give off a beautiful turquoise shimmer, something that will catch your attention even from a great distance.<br><br>

		<h2>Minor Basilica of St. Martin of Tours</h2><br><br>
		<h3>Basílica Menor de San Martín de Tours</h3><br>
		In 1575, three years after the founding of the town of Taal in its old site near the shores of Taal Lake, work began on the construction of its first church by Diego Espinar with Martin of Tours as patron saint. The church was rebuilt in 1642 using stronger materials, but it was destroyed in 1754 along with the town of Taal in the largest recorded eruption of the Taal Volcano. This event led to transfer of the town and the church farther away from the volcano to its present site atop an elevated hill facing Balayan Bay. The ruins of the previous church can still be seen in the present-day town of San Nicolas.

Martín Aguirre donated the land and began the construction of the new church in 1755. It was continued by Gabriel Rodriguez in 1777 and by Jose Victoria in 1782. Ramon del Marco decorated the church, built the convent, and paved the "processional" road with bricks around the atrium of the parochial building.[3] This church was damaged by a strong earthquake on September 16, 1852, centered near the Taal Volcano, though no volcanic eruption was recorded.<br><br>
