		The Batangas State University (translated in Filipino as Pambansang Pamantasan ng Batangas and abbreviated as BatStateU) is a state university in the province of Batangas, Philippines.[8] Established in 1903 as a training school, Batangas State University is the oldest higher education institution in the region.[9] It was granted a state college status in 1968, renamed Pablo Borbon Memorial Institute of Technology, and was finally elevated into a state university in 2001.[2][1] At present, the university has eleven campuses in Batangas.[10]

Since 1999, Batangas State University has been consistently the top and the second top performing mechanical engineering school in the country based on the results of the biannual board examinations.<br><br>
Batangas State University was originally established as the Manual Training School in 1903 through the supervision of its first American principal, Mr. Scheer. The institution aimed to train youth for beneficial jobs specifically in woodworking. Two years later, it was renamed Batangas Trade School with Mr. Schartz, Zacarias Canent, Isaias Maclang, and Nad Pascual Magcamit as its principals, successively. The school was destroyed by fire in 1928 and classes were held temporarily at the old government building near the present Basilica of Immaculate Conception church. The construction of the school building at the site of Batangas State University's Main Campus I began in 1932.[2][4]

After the Liberation, Batangas Trade School resumed activities on 10 September 1945 with Vicente J. Mendoza as its principal. Under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946, the school was renovated, and the first batch of female students were admitted when courses in food trade, garment, and cosmetology were introduced as a response to the growing need of female workforce.<br><br>
